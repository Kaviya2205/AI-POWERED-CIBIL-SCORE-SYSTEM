🧠 AI-Powered CIBIL Score Prediction System

This project presents a machine learning-based solution to **predict and analyze an individual's CIBIL score** using key financial indicators. It aims to automate the credit scoring process, enhance decision-making for lenders, and promote financial inclusion by offering a transparent, data-driven approach to creditworthiness assessment.

---

🔍 **Project Objectives**
- Predict whether an individual has a good or bad CIBIL score based on financial and behavioral data.
- Enable banks and financial institutions to **automate loan approval pipelines**.
- Provide users with insights on **what factors affect their credit score**.

---

🧰 **Technologies Used**
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** – for data analysis and visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – for building and evaluating ML models
- **Streamlit** – for creating an interactive web application
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** – for development and experimentation

---

🏗️ **Features**
- 🧠 Machine Learning model trained on synthetic/realistic credit data
- 📊 Visualization of factors influencing CIBIL score
- ✅ Classification of users as "Good Credit" or "Bad Credit"
- 🌐 Streamlit interface for user-friendly predictions
- 📈 Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
