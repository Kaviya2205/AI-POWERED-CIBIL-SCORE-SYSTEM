🧠 AI-Powered CIBIL Score Prediction System

This project presents a machine learning-based solution to predict and analyze an individual's CIBIL score using key financial indicators. It aims to automate the credit scoring process, enhance decision-making for lenders, and promote financial inclusion by offering a transparent, data-driven approach to creditworthiness assessment.

🔍 Project Objectives
Predict whether an individual has a good or bad CIBIL score based on financial and behavioral data.
Enable banks and financial institutions to automate loan approval pipelines.
Provide users with insights on what factors affect their credit score.
🧰 Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn – for data analysis and visualization
Scikit-learn – for building and evaluating ML models
Streamlit – for creating an interactive web application
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook – for development and experimentation
🏗️ Features
🧠 Machine Learning model trained on synthetic/realistic credit data
📊 Visualization of factors influencing CIBIL score
✅ Classification of users as "Good Credit" or "Bad Credit"
🌐 Streamlit interface for user-friendly predictions
📈 Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
